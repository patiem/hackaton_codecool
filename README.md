# hackaton_codecool - Python Part

Those who enter this repository - forgive us! 
It was our first hackaton, it was really hard 24 hours, it was extreme exhaustion of our brains.
Forgive us for lack of clean code, forgive us for comments in commits, forgive us for chaos!

But despite all the shortcomings we managed to win :)
